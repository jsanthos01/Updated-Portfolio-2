This is the second iteration of my personal website. With each iteration, I strive to improve my design skills as well as use more languages that I have learned to enhance the overall appearance/layout of  the website. I designed it using the following technologies:

* CSS
* HTML
* Javascript
* Bootstrap(Minimal Usage)
